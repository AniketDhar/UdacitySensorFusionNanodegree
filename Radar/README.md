# FMCW Radar Target Detection using 2D FFT and CFAR

This project implements a radar signal processing pipeline using **FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave)** techniques to detect a moving target's **range** and **velocity**. The final target detection is performed using a **Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)** filter applied on a **2D FFT Range-Doppler Map (RDM)**.

## üìå Project Goals

- Simulate a radar environment with a moving target.
- Generate FMCW waveforms and simulate transmitted/received signals.
- Process the beat signal using **1D FFT** for range measurement.
- Process the beat signal using **2D FFT** for range-velocity (doppler) estimation.
- Apply **CFAR** to detect targets in noisy conditions.
- Visualize and interpret results at every stage.

## Pipeline Overview

The radar signal processing pipeline follows these key steps:

1. **Signal Simulation:**
   - Define radar and target parameters.
   - Generate transmitted (Tx) and received (Rx) signals based on time delays.
   - Generate the beat signal by mixing Tx and Rx.

2. **Range Measurement (1D FFT):**
   - Reshape the beat signal.
   - Perform FFT on each chirp (row) to estimate range.
   - Plot single-sided amplitude spectrum.

3. **Range-Doppler Map (2D FFT):**
   - Reshape the beat signal.
   - Perform 2D FFT across range and doppler dimensions.
   - Apply logarithmic scaling for better visualization.

4. **CFAR Detection:**
   - Slide a training-guard cell window over the RDM.
   - Estimate noise level, compute threshold.
   - Detect peaks above threshold.
   - Generate binary detection map.
